     <p> Kings 19:11-13 "11 And he said, Go forth, and stand
     upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord 
     passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, 
     and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord 
     was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but 
     the Lord was not in the earthquake: 12 And after the earthquake
     a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a 
     still small voice. 13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that
     he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in 
     the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice
     unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?"</p>

     to form, what I see during the time between sleep & wakefulness;
     mapping this deam space. I see it as my most natural sense 
     & conection to the Earth." - Cynthia McCauley Boos</p>
